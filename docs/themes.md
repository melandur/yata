# Themes

yata styles the interface with nine semantic color tokens. Bundled themes are the fallback on any Linux desktop; Azure Glow is the default. Settings presents all 95 bundled themes in one searchable, light/dark-filterable scrolling catalog.

Tinted Base16 entries map colors to yata tokens as follows: `base00` to background, `base01` to surface, `base05` to text, `base0D` to accent, `base08` to danger, `base02` to muted and highlight, `base03` to border, and `base04` to dim text. Source revision and licensing details are recorded in [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).

## Custom theme files

Custom themes are TOML files in:

```text
~/.config/yata/themes/<theme-id>.toml
```

The settings configurator writes the same format, so generated themes can be edited or shared:

```toml
name = "Ocean Blue"
background = "#0c1a2b"
surface = "#122438"
text = "#c9deed"
accent = "#4fd6ff"
danger = "#ff6b7a"
muted = "#1e3a52"
highlight = "#244d68"
border = "#315b75"
dim_text = "#6f8da3"
```

yata discovers valid `.toml` files in this directory on startup and displays them under **Your themes**. If a custom filename matches a bundled theme ID, the custom theme replaces that bundled entry so saved preferences and selection always use the user’s palette.

## Omarchy Quattro

On Omarchy Quattro, yata detects the active theme from:

```text
~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme.name
~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml
```

The application maps Quattro's `background`, `foreground`, `accent`, `selection`, and `color8` values into its semantic tokens and monitors the current-theme state for changes. It defaults to following Omarchy on first launch.

The system option is not shown when a valid Quattro current-theme state is unavailable. If that state disappears while yata is running, following turns off and yata returns to the selected built-in theme. Legacy Omarchy theme layouts and alacritty-based color extraction are intentionally unsupported.
