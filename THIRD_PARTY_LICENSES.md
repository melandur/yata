# Third-party notices

Strata includes or derives assets from the following projects.

## JetBrains Mono

- Project: <https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono>
- Version: 2.304
- Copyright: JetBrains s.r.o.
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1
- Included asset: `data/fonts/JetBrainsMono[wght].ttf`
- Full license: [`data/licenses/JetBrainsMono-OFL-1.1.txt`](data/licenses/JetBrainsMono-OFL-1.1.txt)

The font is distributed unmodified. Strata materializes the embedded font in its private cache at runtime so it is available without changing the user's system font installation.

## Lucide

- Project: <https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide>
- Version: 1.35.0
- Copyright: Lucide Contributors and Feather Icons contributors
- License: ISC
- Included assets: curated and namespaced SVG icons under `data/icons/scalable/actions/`
- Full license: [`data/licenses/Lucide-ISC.txt`](data/licenses/Lucide-ISC.txt)

The SVGs retain Lucide geometry. Their foreground color was changed from `currentColor` to GTK's symbolic foreground color so GTK can recolor them according to the active theme.

## Tinted Theming schemes

- Project: <https://github.com/tinted-theming/schemes>
- Revision: `fdca32a0d14ec80ad83a78a9ccb85592ca6cb9e1`
- Copyright: Tinted Theming and the scheme authors identified by the upstream files
- License: MIT
- Derived asset: `data/themes/catalog.toml`
- Full license: [`data/licenses/Tinted-Theming-MIT.txt`](data/licenses/Tinted-Theming-MIT.txt)

The bundled catalog contains curated Base16 palettes derived from this project alongside Strata's original themes. The Base16 mapping to Strata's semantic UI tokens is documented in the catalog.

## GTK and GStreamer media-runtime patch kit

- Projects: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk> and <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer>
- Source versions: GTK 4.22.4 and gst-plugins-bad 1.28.6
- License of the patched source files: LGPL-2.0-or-later (GTK's project license is LGPL-2.1-or-later)
- Included material: source-context patches under `packaging/media-runtime/patches/`
- Full licenses: [GTK](packaging/media-runtime/licenses/GTK-COPYING) and [GStreamer](packaging/media-runtime/licenses/GSTREAMER-COPYING)

The experimental patch kit preserves upstream source notices and identifies pinned
source archives. It does not bundle toolkit binaries or alter Strata's release
artifacts. See its [build and redistribution requirements](packaging/media-runtime/README.md).

## UnRAR

- Project: <https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm>
- Bundled source: UnRAR 7.01 (2024-05-12), statically linked by `unrar_sys` 0.5.8
- Copyright: Alexander Roshal
- License: custom UnRAR license; **not** MIT or Apache-2.0
- Full license: [`data/licenses/UnRAR.txt`](data/licenses/UnRAR.txt), also shipped as `UnRAR.txt` in release archives

UnRAR permits RAR extraction but prohibits using its source to develop a
RAR-compatible archiver or recreate the proprietary RAR compression algorithm.
The wrapper crates' permissive metadata does not cover this native implementation.
The pinned crate archive has SHA-256
`8b77675b883cfbe6bf41e6b7a5cd6008e0a83ba497de3d96e41a064bbeead765`.
Strata does not modify its vendored source.

## Rust dependencies

Rust dependency licenses are declared in each package's metadata and are validated in CI with `cargo-deny`. To review the current dependency graph locally, run:

```bash
cargo deny check licenses
```

### arrayref

The bundled icon renderer uses `arrayref` 0.3.9 through `resvg` / `tiny-skia`.
Its BSD-2-Clause license requires the following notice in binary distributions.
This document is included in release archives and installed license materials.

## Yazi

`data/yazi-icons.toml` contains the file-type icon table from
[yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) (`yazi-config/preset/theme-dark.toml`),
and the bundled "Yazi" theme is derived from that preset's palette. Yazi is
licensed under the MIT License, Copyright (c) 2023-present yazi contributors.
The glyphs themselves come from Nerd Fonts and render with the reader's own
Nerd Font.
